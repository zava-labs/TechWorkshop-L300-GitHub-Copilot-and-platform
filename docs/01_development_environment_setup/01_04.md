# Task 04 - Build the solution

## Introduction

Now that Visual Studio Code and your development tools are setup, you can begin working on the lab. First you will need to clone the forked repository and verify the starting point of the solution.

## Description

During this task you will clone the repository you forked, and build the solution to ensure you have a baseline for the next exercises.

## Success Criteria

- You have cloned the lab repository you forked
- You are able to build the solution and run it locally

## Learning Resources

- Cloning a repository via the [command line](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop)

## Key Tasks

### 01: Clone the forked repository

Clone the repository you forked to your local machine so you can work with the code locally.

1. Clone the repository using the git clone command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-fork-name>.git
    ```

    Make sure to replace `<your-username>` with your actual GitHub username, and `<your-fork-name>` with the repository name where you forked the code.

2. Optionally, you can shorten the folder name by following this command with a folder name such as `ZavaLabFork`:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-fork-name>.git ZavaLabFork
    ```

### 02: Build and run the solution locally

Build and run the .NET solution locally in Visual Studio Code to verify your development environment is configured correctly.

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code

    Launch VS Code and open the folder containing your cloned repository.

2. Restore dependencies

    Open a terminal in VS Code and navigate to the `src` folder. From there, restore the solution:

    ```bash
    cd src
    dotnet restore
    ```

3. Build the solution

    To build the solution run the following command:

    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```

    > **NOTE** Ignore any warnings you see in the output window. These will be addressed with the later .NET upgrade.

4. Run the application

    Run the application from the command line:

    ```bash
    dotnet run --project src/ZavaStorefront.csproj
    ```

    This will start the web application. Review the terminal output to find the local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5000` or similar).

5. Open the application in your browser

    Navigate to the local URL to view and interact with the running solution.

    > **NOTE** If you encounter any issues, verify that .NET 6 is installed and your dependencies are restored. For troubleshooting, consult the official [.NET documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/get-started).

## Summary

You've completed this task. You have cloned the lab repository you forked and are able to build the solution and run it locally.
