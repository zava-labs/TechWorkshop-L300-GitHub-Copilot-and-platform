# Task 03 - Install necessary software

## Introduction

Before you clone the repository you just forked, you will set up your development environment and install the components that will be needed for this training lab.

## Description

To work through this training lab, you will need .NET 6 to support the lab starting point, and .NET LTS to support the target state of the solution. In addition, you will need other tools and extensions for Visual Studio Code in order to complete step in later exercises. In this task you will install the necessary software to complete the work.

## Success Criteria

- You have installed .NET 6 and .NET LTS
- You have set up your Visual Studio Code environment and installed necessary extensions for this lab

## Learning Resources

- [.NET versions](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet)
- [Azure CLI documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest)
- [Installing Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- [Installing Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)


## Key Tasks

### 01: Install .NET 6 and .NET LTS
