# Task 04 - Deploy an observability workbook

## Introduction

Azure Workbooks help you visualize operational diagnostics for your Azure AI Services resource.

## Description

In this task, you will create and deploy an Azure Workbook that visualizes operational diagnostics for your Azure AI Services resource. The workbook uses only platform diagnostics emitted to AzureDiagnostics, without any application-level telemetry.

You will first validate each KQL query manually in Log Analytics, then use GitHub Copilot to generate the Bicep scaffolding and placeholder JSON, and finally paste in the provided workbook definition and deploy it to your environment.

## Success Criteria

You have successfully completed Task 04 when:

1. All three KQL queries return data in Log Analytics when run manually:

- Request volume

- Latency percentiles

- Operation-name breakdown

2. The workbook deploys successfully using your Bicep template and the provided JSON.
3. The workbook appears under: Azure Monitor → Workbooks → AI Services Observability
4. All three visuals load and display real data:
   - Request volume over time
   - Latency percentiles (p50/p95/p99)
   - Requests by operation name over time

## Key Tasks

### 01: Run Diagnostic Queries Manually

Run diagnostic queries in Log Analytics to confirm your Azure AI Services resource is emitting data before creating the workbook.

<summary><strong>Expand this section for detailed steps</strong></summary>

1. Navigate to your Log Analytics workspace in the Azure portal.

2. Open the Logs query editor.

3. Run the Request Volume query. You should see a time series showing your model invocation volume:

    ```kusto
    AzureDiagnostics
    | where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.COGNITIVESERVICES"
    | where Category == "RequestResponse"
    | summarize Requests = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
    | order by TimeGenerated asc
    ```

4. Run the Latency Percentiles query. You should see p50/p95/p99 latency patterns for all model calls:

    ```kusto
    AzureDiagnostics
    | where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.COGNITIVESERVICES"
    | where Category == "RequestResponse"
    | summarize
        p50 = percentiles(DurationMs, 50),
        p95 = percentiles(DurationMs, 95),
        p99 = percentiles(DurationMs, 99)
      by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
    | order by TimeGenerated asc
    ```

5. Run the Breakdown by operation name query. This shows the number of requests by operation name:

    ```kusto
    AzureDiagnostics
    | where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.COGNITIVESERVICES"
    | where Category == "RequestResponse"
    | extend Operation = OperationName
    | summarize Count = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m), Operation
    | order by TimeGenerated asc
    ```

### 02: Use Copilot to Create Workbook Scaffolding

Use GitHub Copilot Chat to generate the Bicep template and placeholder JSON file for the Azure Workbook.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section for detailed steps</strong></summary>

1. Open your project folder in VS Code.

2. Prompt GitHub Copilot with the following:

    ```text
    Generate a workbook.bicep template and a placeholder workbook JSON file for an Azure Workbook named "AI Services Observability."
    The workbook will visualize three queries: request volume, latency percentiles, and breakdown by operation name.
    Use a Log Analytics workspace as the data source.
    ```

3. Review the generated workbook.bicep and workbook.json files. Copilot will produce:
   - workbook.bicep
   - workbook.json (placeholder)

4. If the generated files look correct, approve them.

> **NOTE** Do not provision the workbook yet, proceed to the next step.

### 03: Replace the Placeholder JSON

Replace the placeholder JSON in the workbook.json file with the final workbook definition that includes all three visualization queries.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section for detailed steps</strong></summary>

1. Open your project folder in VS Code.

2. Open the workbook.json file.

3. Overwrite the file with the following content:

    ```json
    {
      "version": "Notebook/1.0",
      "items": [
        {
