# Exercise 03: Build and deploy a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

## Scenario

This training will have you using Copilot features for development and also to automate devops delivery for the Zava solution.

In the previous exercise, you used Copilot to create a GitHub issue and to generate the infrastructure Bicep scripts from the issue. You also deployed the infrastructure so that it is ready for deploying the solution. 

In this exercise, you will create a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline (workflow) to build and containerize the Zava web application and then deploy it to your previously created Azure infrastructure.

## Objectives

After completing this exercise, you'll be able to:

* Create a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline (workflow)
* Test the workflow as part of the Pull Request process
* Monitor and review the results of the workflow
* Troubleshoot issues with the workflow

## Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 60 minutes
