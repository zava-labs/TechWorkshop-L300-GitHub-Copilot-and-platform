# Task 01 - Create and run a GitHub Actions workflow

## Introduction

Now that the infrastructure for the Zava Storefront solution is deployed, you will be automating the deployment of the solution using GitHub Actions.

## Description

In this task you will automate the deployment of Zava's .NET app to Azure App Service for Containers using GitHub Actions.

## Success Criteria

- You have created and executed a GitHub Actions workflow
- The workflow results have completed the following steps:
  - Built and containerized the solution
  - Pushed the image to the Azure Container Registry (ACR)
  - Deployed the application to the App Service

## Learning Resources

## Key Tasks

### 01: Ask Copilot to create a GitHub Actions Workflow

Use GitHub Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code to generate a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys the Zava application as a container to Azure App Service.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section for detailed steps</strong></summary>

1. In Visual Studio Code → Copilot Chat, type a prompt such as the following:

    ```text
    Create a minimal quickstart GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy this dotnet app as a container to
    the app service I've already defined in the infra folder.  Include a minimal readme explaining how to
    configure GitHub secrets and variables but no other scripts or files.
    ```

2. Copilot should create a workflow YAML file in the folder `.github/workflows`. The file name may vary but it might be something like `deploy-dotnet-app.yml`.

    The following image illustrates an example Copilot interaction for this step.

    ![Copilot interaction to create workflow YAML](../../media/0301_copilot_workflow_yaml.png)

3. Verify the resulting folders and files that should be created:

</details>

### 02: Add the Workflow to GitHub Actions

Add a Pull Request trigger to the workflow YAML so you can test the workflow via a Pull Request before merging to the default branch.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section for detailed steps</strong></summary>

1. Review the workflow YAML file and check if a `pull_request` trigger exists (Copilot may have added it already).

2. If the trigger is missing, find the triggers at the top of the file and add it. See the example below:

   ```yaml
   on:
   push:
      branches: [ main ]
      paths: [ 'src/**' ]
   pull_request:
      branches: [ '*' ]
   workflow_dispatch:
   ```

3. The full view of a workflow YAML output is shown here:

   ```yaml
   name: Build and Deploy to Azure App Service

   on:
   push:
      branches: [ main ]
   pull_request:
      branches: [ main ]
   workflow_dispatch:

   env:
   REGISTRY: ${{ vars.AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_NAME }}.azurecr.io
   IMAGE_NAME: simplestore
   APP_NAME: ${{ vars.AZURE_APP_SERVICE_NAME }}

   jobs:
   build-and-deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      steps:
      - name: Checkout code
         uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Log in to Azure
         uses: azure/login@v2
         with:
         creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

      - name: Log in to Azure Container Registry
         run: az acr login --name ${{ vars.AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_NAME }}

      - name: Build and push Docker image
         run: |
         # Build the Docker image
         docker build -t ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ github.sha }} -t ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:latest ./src

         # Push both tags to registry
         docker push ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ github.sha }}
         docker push ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:latest

      - name: Deploy to Azure App Service
         uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v3
         with:
         app-name: ${{ env.APP_NAME }}
         images: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ github.sha }}
   ```

</details>

### 03: Review the generated deployment README file

Review the deployment README file generated by Copilot and configure the required GitHub secrets and variables as documented.

> **NOTE** Based on the choices Copilot makes during the generation of the workflow YAML, specific secret and variable names may differ for each person. In addition, there may be more or less details depending on the approach Copilot took to generate the results.

<details markdown="block">

# GitHub Actions Deployment Setup

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and deploys your .NET application as a container to Azure App Service.

## Prerequisites

Before the workflow can run successfully, you need to configure the following GitHub secrets and variables:

### Required GitHub secrets

1. **AZURE_CREDENTIALS** - Azure service principal credentials for authentication

   To create this secret:

   ```bash
   # Create a service principal with contributor access to your resource group
   az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "github-actions-sp" \
     --role contributor \
     --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name} \
     --json-auth
   ```

   Copy the entire JSON output and paste it as the value for the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.

### Required GitHub variables

1. **AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_NAME** - The name of your Azure Container Registry (without .azurecr.io)
2. **AZURE_APP_SERVICE_NAME** - The name of your Azure App Service

### How to configure secrets and variables

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Add the secret under the **Secrets** tab
4. Add the variables under the **Variables** tab

### Service principal permissions

The service principal needs the following permissions:
- **Contributor** role on the resource group (for App Service deployment)
- **AcrPush** role on the Azure Container Registry (for pushing container images)

To assign the ACR role:
```bash
az role assignment create \
  --assignee {service-principal-client-id} \
  --role AcrPush \
  --scope /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/{acr-name}
```

## Workflow Behavior

The workflow triggers on:
- Push to `main` branch
- Pull requests to `main` branch
- Manual trigger via GitHub UI

The workflow will:
1. Build your .NET application as a Docker container
2. Push the container to your Azure Container Registry
3. Deploy the container to your Azure App Service

## Finding Your Resource Names

You can find your resource names by running:
```bash
# List your resource groups
az group list --output table

# List resources in your resource group
az resource list --resource-group {your-resource-group-name} --output table
```

Look for resources with types:
- `Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries` (for ACR name)
- `Microsoft.Web/sites` (for App Service name)

</details>

### 04: Commit and push your workflow file

Commit and push the workflow file to your feature branch so you can create a Pull Request to test the workflow.

> **NOTE** Make sure you're pushing to the correct branch. You should have a feature branch created in Exercise 2. This will support the next step where you will create a Pull Request to test this workflow before merging to main.
